# Ansible SQL 2012 and 2014 uninstallation role

Anyone that has browsed the internet on #subject knows that uninstalling SQL Server can be a painful undertaking. Most guides suggest using the GUI or provide an incomplete picture of the components required. This playbook/role provides a quick and dirty way to rip out the 2012/2104 SQL components required for reinstallation. This playbook does not handle users as these are likely dependent on the specific installation.

There is definitely room for a ton of improvment here! Please feel free to submit pull requests on the basis that they are well tested.
